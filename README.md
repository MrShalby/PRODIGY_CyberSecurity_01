# Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

## About

This is a simple Python project that performs Caesar Cipher Encoding and Decoding based on user input. The user can enter a message and a desired shift value, and the program will either encode or decode the message accordingly. The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features

- Encode messages with a custom shift value
- Decode encrypted messages using the shift value
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
